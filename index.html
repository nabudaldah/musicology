    <h1>Musicology</h1>

    <p><strong>Nabi Abudaldah, 2021</strong></p>

    <p>From the science in music cognition, we know that humans all have musicality. Three months before we are born, we already recognize melodies! How cool is that? This page is a music theory <em>cheat-sheet</em>. To get you from zero to understanding the cultural theory of music in order to make music that sounds great! Let's start with sounds.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>Sound</h2>
    
    <p>In nature, anything that vibrates pressurizes gasses in the air and these tiny pressurizations can be perceived by our ears and is interpreted by our brains. When a string of any material is tensioned, it vibrates in a very orderly way. The way it moves generates a vibration that we call a <em>sine</em> wave. Most sounds in nature are not a pure single sine wave, but if they are, they look something like this:</p>

    <figure>
      <div id="figure1" style="width: 800px; height: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 1: a sine wave visualized</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>While no sound in nature is purely sinusoidal, all sounds are made up of combinations of pure sine waves that are added together!</p>

    <h2>Pitch</h2>

    A perfect sine wave has a certain pitch. That is the frequency or the speed of its vibration per second expressed in Hertz and abbreviated as Hz.

    <figure>
      <div id="figure2" style="width: 800px; height: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 2: the pitch of 440Hz is culturally called "A" or "A4"</figcaption>
    </figure>

    Both the frequency as the labelling of pitches is cultural and has changed over time and place. The human hearing system can typically perceive vibration between 20Hz and 20,000Hz. Human voice typically ranges between 85Hz and 255Hz.

    <h2>Octaves</h2>

    <p>Some pitches sound pleasant to us humans. One of the pitches that go well together are pitches that are exact multiples of each other. Any pitch that is doubled in frequency sounds well with it's base frequency.</p>

    <figure>
      <div id="figure3" style="width: 800px; height: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 3: doubling the pitch of A results in a higher octave of A</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Somehow, we perceive this as being the same <em>tone</em>. This relationship is called an <em>octave</em> and is universal across cultures. However, this simple ratio of 1 to 2 is only one of the many ratios that sound great!</p>

    <h2>Harmonics</h2>

    <p>The doubling of a pitch is already a <em>harmonic</em>. Tripling a pitch is also a harmonic! But multiplying a pitch by 3:2 or 4:3 and 5:3 are all harmonics of that pitch. These simple ratio multiplications of a pitch sound pleasing together and they are called the <em>harmonic series</em>.</p>

    <figure>
      <div id="figure4" style="width: 800px; height: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 4: Harmonic series visualized as sine waves and their relationship</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>For still unknown reason, we find these simple ratios between pitches very pleasant, while we feel tension when these ratios are more "complicated" ratios, such as 89:53 or 241:479.</p>

    <p>These simple multiples of the pitch, or simple mathematical ratios of the pitch, sounds great together and are the fundamentals of notes, scales and chords that we use to make music that sounds great to us!</p>

    <h2>Chromatic Scale</h2>

    Historically in Western music, 12 pitches have been used to make music. These 12 pitches are together called the <em>chromatic scale</em>. While 12 discrete pitches are arbitrary and cultural, there is some foundation as to how it got to the number 12, given the harmonic series that sound great together: there are a few well spread out pitches that have simple ratios between them.

    <figure>
      <div id="figure5" style="width: 800px; height: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 5: the 7 pitches from a base note C4 that have simple ratio´s</figcaption>
    </figure>

    But as you see, there are some big gaps! Especially between A and B there is nothing. To make these pitch jumps a little smaller, in-between notes where invented with less simple ratios.

    <figure>
      <div id="figure6" style="width: 800px; height: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 6: the 12 pitches with less simple ratios but equally spaced that make up most popular music</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Doesn't this look oddly familiar? Yes it does! It's the piano keys. The white and black keys. In practice however, tuning instruments isn't done using these simple ratios, but rather the twelve equal temperament tuning system.</p>

    <figure>
      <div id="figure7" style="width: 800px; height: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 7: the piano key layout with white (natural) and black keys (accidentals)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The piano in C has become the "QWERTY" layout of music input devices. But beware, you do not need to use a classical piano keys layout to make music! Below are some alternatives that are more straight forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Resources: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFbG-8eYKJU">Casey Connor, 12-Tone Scales</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT9CPoe5LnM">Steven Jacks, Twelve Notes in Music</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Tuning</h2>

    <p>Tuning mechanical devices, such as piano's and guitars, to consistently reproduce exact pitches, is a complicated and cumbersome business, especially when having many octaves of tones to reproduce for a whole orchestra! Therefore the equal temperament tuning was invented with A4 at 440Hz. The logarithmic scale comes very close to the simple ratios that have made their way into the chromatic scale.</p>

    <figure>
      <div id="figure8" style="width: 800px; height: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 8: frequencies of the simple ratios (white) and equal temperament (orange).</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Using this method, each note has the exact same distance in terms of pitch ratio to any other note. This makes every instrument a little "out of tune" compared to the simple pitch ratios, but it is acceptable for the benefit it provides.</p>

    <h2>Chords</h2>

    <p>While electronic instruments have the ability to generate many types of lush sounds, on classical instruments we can play multiple notes at the same time to make them sound fuller, richer and more lush. Playing the different notes at the same time on the same instrument is called playing a <em>chord</em>.</p>

    <figure>
      <div id="figure9" style="width: 800px; height: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 9: the major triad</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The most well-known chords are the <strong>major triads</strong> and <strong>minor triads</strong>. These are called triads as one is said to play three notes at the same time. The major triad is playing the <em>unison</em>, the <em>major third</em> and the <em>fifth</em> at the same time.</p>

    <figure>
      <div id="figure10" style="width: 800px; height: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 10: the minor triad</figcaption>
    </figure>    

    <p>The <em>minor triad</em> is playing the <em>unison</em>, the <em>minor third</em> and the <em>fifth</em>. But you can play any number of notes at the same time to your liking. Once that sound great have a simple harmonic relationship though!</p>

    <h2>Modes</h2>

    <p>Some notes are more harmonious or consonant together while others sound more dissonant. Modes are a great way to reduce the number of notes and give a certain feel to your music! Let's reconsider the pentatonic scale or the 7 natural notes that have simple relationships. Let's leave out the name of notes and simply look at the ratios:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <div id="figure11" style="width: 800px; height: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 11: the 7 pitches with simple ratio´s</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>As you can see, there are jumps over the accidental ratio´s. Going from <em>unison</em> to <em>major third</em> we skip one note in between, this is a "whole step" jump. Going from <em>major third</em> to <em>fourth</em> we don't need to skip a note of the chromatic scale, this is a "half step" jump. Let's remove the more complicated ratios from the 12 notes in the chromatic scale to be left with only the 7-tones of the natural scale:</p>

    <figure>
      <div id="figure12" style="width: 800px; height: 200px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 12: the 7 simple ratios of the natural scale starts at <em>unison</em></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Modes are transpositions of the order or sequence of jumps that are in the 7 natural tones. Let´s see how this works when transposing (or "shifting" or "sliding") the original sequence of simple pitch ratios:</p>

    <figure>
      <div id="figure13" style="width: 800px; height: 1200px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 13: Modes are transpositions of the distances between the 7-natural tones</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Resources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music)">Wikipedia Mode</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Playing</h2>

    <p>We have seen the piano layout of notes starting at C in the Ionian mode being the white keys and the accidentals being the black keys. This is one way of generating melodic ideas. Modern electronics have the ability to visualize and change their keys to certain notes:</p>

    <figure>
      <div id="figure14" style="width: 800px; height: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 14: touch-sensitive pads set to C♯ in Myxolidian mode (orange is root, white are in mode)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Here we see a 4 by 4 pad that light up the root note, in this case a C♯, and only shows other notes in Myxolidian mode. This allows for exploring musical ideas without having to do the translations of underlying modes and their notes in relation to a set root note and the fixed musical keyboard of the piano.</p>

    <figure>
      <div id="figure15" style="width: 800px; height: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
      <figcaption>Figure 15: pads set to F♯ in Dorian mode</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Within a few seconds, you can switch the pads to a completely different mode using a different root note! This allows exploration of music without the full muscle memory needed to learn a new mode.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Rhythms and melodies are natural to us. Therefore, music needs no theory. But coming from zero musical background, it can be daunting to understand what is going on when other musicians use jargon that seems so abstract. I hope you grasped the basics here and feel confident to not only listen to your favorite artists but start making your own melodies and rhythms!</p>
